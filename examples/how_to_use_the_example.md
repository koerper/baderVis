## Example: Volmer reaction at magnesium-water interface
#### How to use the example
1. Process the Bader analysis results
* Use `baderProc.sh -m neb` at the base of the NEB folder structure for processing each folder
* Use `baderProc.sh -m single` in a single folder for processing
2. Visualize the Bader analysis results 
* Use `baderVis.sh` at the base of the NEB folder structure to visualize the Bader charge evolution of the entire reaction path.
* Use `baderVis.sh -m single` in a single folder to visualize the system with according Bader charges
